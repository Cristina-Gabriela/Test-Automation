In this article,
we are going to
learn about 4 Ways
to Convert text file
to dictionary in Python.
This is a very helpful
exercise for programmers
who works with data files.
As a Data Analyst or Data
scientist when we have huge
data in files then we
need to convert that
data into python objects.
This conversion helps
us in handling the
data in an organized manner.

We will learn about
one of the use cases
where we will be
converting the
text file data
to a Python
dictionary object.
To understand this,
We will take a sample
text file and will read the content,
and load it in the Python dictionary.
