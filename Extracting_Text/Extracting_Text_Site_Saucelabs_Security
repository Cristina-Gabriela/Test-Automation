SecurityWe take security seriously at Sauce Labs Whether it is the code we write, the software we use or the platform services we provide, security is always extremely important. We know that you rely on Sauce to help your developers deliver better software faster, and we are committed to protecting your investment. We’re SOC 2 Type 2 and ISO 27001 certified and available to answer any security questions you may have.
Ask us a questionReport a security issueOur commitment to securitySauce Labs is a company built on community and trust; we firmly believe that transparency and honesty are the only ways to build and maintain that trust. At Sauce Labs, we promise to disclose all relevant information in the event of a security incident, however our first directive is to keep our customers secure and operational. In the event that disclosure may increase the risk to our customers, we ask for sufficient time to resolve the vulnerability before sharing the information.
Another aspect of community is the goal of contributing to the health of the group as a whole. Any individual or group that discovers and subsequently notifies Sauce Labs of a current or potential issue is fully credited for their contribution (unless requested otherwise).
